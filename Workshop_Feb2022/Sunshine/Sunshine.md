# Story: Spooktacular

Every year, there is a very (1) day that we look forward to. Halloween, of course. It’s when (2) come out to eat candy with (3) little brothers and friends dressed as (4), too. Even mean (5) thinks Halloween is fun, and gives (6) away for trick or treat. In our family, we bob for (7), and carve pumpkins before our quest for candy begins. This year, I’m going to be (8) and I’m going to make my little baby brother dress up as a (9). My goal is to find (10) (11) and find all the (12) in the neighbourhood. When I get home, I want to make a fort in the (13) where only kids, candy and jewelry are invited. This is going to be my new Halloween tradition, and (14) will be the annual anthem. Happy Halloween, you Spooktacular (15)!
