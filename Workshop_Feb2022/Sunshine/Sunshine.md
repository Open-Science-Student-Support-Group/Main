# Story: Spooktacular

Every year, there is a very Reading-week ready day that we look forward to. Halloween, of course. It’s when Dragon come out to eat candy with silly little brothers and friends dressed as PB&J sandwhich, too. Even mean my advisor of course thinks Halloween is fun, and gives yogurt away for trick or treat. In our family, we bob for strawberry, and carve pumpkins before our quest for candy begins. This year, I’m going to be harry potter and I’m going to make my little baby brother dress up as a carrot. My goal is to find ten hair scrunchie and find all the chocolate in the neighbourhood. When I get home, I want to make a fort in the office where only kids, candy and jewelry are invited. This is going to be my new Halloween tradition, and yellow-by-coldplay  will be the annual anthem. Happy Halloween, you Spooktacular dragon!
